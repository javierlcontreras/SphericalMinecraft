FOR THE MVP
Creative Mode on one single ultra flat planet with custom radius and custom layers
    BUGS
        - quads have two different normals, gives a weird lighting artifact
        - Character controler stil gets head in into stuff, the only raycast are at the feet, should have raycasts on top as well
        - Place a block on you feet makes you fall through mesh
        - Pointing is broken by making air blocks nulls to save memory
        - Change of width layers are still wonky. Some more geometry needs to be done
        - clouds and atmosphere are manually placed, they dont take the planet radius automatically
        - Leaves should be transparent when placed as blocks. How does minecraft do this?
        - Shadow casting is broken, lower parts of blocks in the night area are bright. Also caves are bright
        - Placing a block in a chunk by clicking on the one close to it in another chunk is broken, needs better adjacency functions
        - max fall speed on the player, so that it doesnt pierce the mesh on falls
        - bedrock level is not exact, there is some bug with minHeight
    FEATURES
        - Augment block palette
        - make creative controller be creative, not spectator
        - Init menu
        - Save system
            Free RAM with old chunks to memory
            Create, load and save chunks asyncronously






IN GENERAL (Forget them for now!)
    BUGS
        - celestial mechanics (and planet rotation) makes ChunkCloseEnough broken, need to consider planet rotation
        - Should have a new Planet class, should have Planet Terrain and other properties
    FEATURES
        1) Terrain Generation needs improvement
            Temperature and humidity
            Biomes
            Caves
            Rivers and seas
            Trees
        2) Water is a whole issue
            If I want it to be minecraft-y i need to be super careful because it is part shader part block
        3) Chunk loader needs improvement  
            Which chunks are really necessary? the ones i see etc
        4) Save system + Improvement on Chunking system
            Free RAM with old chunks to memory
            Create, load and save chunks asyncronously
            Save sytem should also save other player information, so make it flexible
        5) Multiplayer!
            This is a whole big problem. Most of computation needs to be clientside because comunication is pricy
            Should probably set up a foo multiplayer first
        6) Lighting? inside caves and also ambient occlusion
        7) Debug system like F3
        8) Textures from scratch
